# Q.4) Create a Python program that checks if a user-given number is positive, negative, or zero.

# CODE:
    
# Get the number from the user
number = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if the number is positive, negative, or zero
if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")

# OUTPUT:

# Enter a number: 5
# The number is positive.

# Enter a number: -92
# The number is negative.

# Enter a number: 0
# The number is zero.
