# Q.1) Write a Python program that takes a number as input and prints "Even" if the number is even and "Odd" if it's odd.

# CODE:

# Get the number from the user
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if the number is even or odd
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")

# OUTPUT:

# Enter a number: 34
# Even

# Enter a number: 45
# Odd
